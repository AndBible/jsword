And Bible fork of JSword. Should be mostly compatible with 
Crosswire's upstream repository, but has some additional functions etc. 
that are needed in And Bible. Only android-specific thing is that 
default gradle configuration also uses slf4j-android-logger.

Moreover, it has community-provided translations of  BibleNames 
from [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/mjdenham/andbible/biblenames/).
